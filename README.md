# Bus Timer
Python app that records bus times, producing a timetable similar to that of swiss and Japanese train service
Currently incomplete, but API and base code are working.

# Next steps:
1. Find a way to run code 24/7 to constantly fetch updates, retrieve entire days worth of bus timings
2. Find a way to run code simultaneously for multiple busses at same time 
3. After enough data is gathered (10+), perform statistical analysis to see average timings, std dev etc (leave 10% of observations as testing group)
